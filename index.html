            <h2>Build yourself a palace in paradise</h2>
            <p>look how many generations have passed away.did they take their wealth with them?did they take their
                palaces
                and
                their high status?were they buried with their gold and silver?did they take their cars and planes with
                them
                to
                the herefter?no!they were stripped even of their clothig,and pleased in their graves in their
                shourds,then
                each
                oh them was asked:who is your loard,who is your prophet,what is your religion?so prepare yourself for
                that
                day;do no grieve or dispare about any worldly comforts,for they are cheap and transiant.nothing will
                abide
                except righteous deeds.</p>
