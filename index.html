            <h2>Build yourself a palace in paradise</h2>
            <p>look how many generations have passed away.did they take their wealth with them?did they take their
                palaces
                and
                their high status?were they buried with their gold and silver?did they take their cars and planes with
                them
                to
                the herefter?no!they were stripped even of their clothig,and pleased in their graves in their
                shourds,then
                each
                oh them was asked:who is your loard,who is your prophet,what is your religion?so prepare yourself for
                that
                day;do no grieve or dispare about any worldly comforts,for they are cheap and transiant.nothing will
                abide
                except righteous deeds.</p>

            <h2>No one is ever completely happy</h2>
            <p>you are making a big mistake if you think that life must always be one hundred percent in your fever.this
                is something that will only happen in paradise.in this world however happiness is relative.you will not
                get everything you want,there will always be some problems,sicknesss,adersity,and trails.so be greatful
                at times of ease and patient at times of hardship.do not be too idealistic and expect good healh with no
                sickness,richness with no poverty,happiness with nothing to spoil your joy,a husband with no negative
                aspects,a friends with no faults.</p>

                <p>the righteous believing women dose not exhust her husband with too many requests.she is content with
                    which Allah has decreed for her.her example in that is the family of the messanger of allah(blessing
                    and
                    peace be upon him)Urwah narrated from his maternal aunt Aishah(may aLLAH be pleased with her) that
                    she
                    used to say "by Allah O son of my brother!we watched the new moon come,then the next,then the
                    next,three
                    new moons in two months,and no fire was lit in the houses of the messenger of Allah.</p>
